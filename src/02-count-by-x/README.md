# Count by X

Write a program that accepts two arguments (x and n) and returns an array of the first (n) multiples of (x).

## Criteria

- Assume both arguments will be positive numbers greater than 0.  
- Return the results as an array.

## Examples

```
  countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
  countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]
```
