## Interview Coding Katas

This set of katas is used to explore coding and problem solving practices in a P2 coding interview.

There are 5 katas to pair on with the interviewer/s, each with an increasing level of complexity.

You're not expected to complete them all. The first kata will be completed by your pairing partner
as an introduction into Test Driven Development (TDD).

Your pairing partner can get you started and feeling comfortable so that you can show us what you
are capable of.

Please ask questions and proceed at your own pace. It is encouraged to use external search and docs.

### Usage

- Install dependencies, recommended with PNPM `pnpm install`
- Run tests for all projects with `pnpm test`
- Run isolated tests for each kata with `pnpm test1`, `pnpm test2` etc
- Format on save will be applied

Optionally, install testing and language server integrations in VS Code to improve the developer experience
